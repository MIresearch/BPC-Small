BPC's small cities include the 203 less populated (relative to BPC's large cities) US metropolitan areas. As large cities, small cities are further divided into five tiers based on their relative performance, with top-ranked cities in Tier 1 and bottom-ranked cities in Tier 5. The interactive figure below shows rankings of the 203 BPC small cities, by tier, as well as gains and drops in rankings compared to previous year.
